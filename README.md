# AI distinguish points using Julia

In collaboration with the University of Central Florida's Department of Statistics, we harnessed the prowess of Julia, a language boasting a computational velocity five times swifter than Python. Our weapon of choice: Flux, Julia's answer to PyTorch, equipped with a high-level API tailored for machine learning and deep learning endeavors.

This dynamic duo facilitated the development of a neural network designed to discern the subtleties between authentic and fabricated data points. The outcome? A commendable accuracy hovering around 85%, even when faced with the challenge of overlapping data points.

Julia's celerity and computational efficiency seamlessly blended with Flux's intuitive machinery, propelling us towards the coveted realm of success in distinguishing real from fake. This collaboration has underscored the potency of Julia and Flux as indispensable tools in the arsenal of cutting-edge data science.
